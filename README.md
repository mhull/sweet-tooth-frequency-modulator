# Sweet Toothüç¶ &ndash; Frequency Modulator

Sounds like either an ice cream truck or a theremin. You pick! May or may not be possessed by spirits.

[Play with the demo](https://mhull.github.io/sweet-tooth-frequency-modulator/) and view usage notes below.

## Usage

- `POWER` Turn Sweet Tooth on or off
- `FREQ` Increase or decrease the frequency that Sweet Tooth is producing. The effect depends on how `MUS` is set
- `VOL` Increase or decrease Sweet Tooth's volume
- `MUS` Use Sweet Tooth in musical scale (ice cream truck) mode
- `THRM` Use Sweet Tooth in theremin mode
- `POSS` Whether or not Sweet Tooth should be possessed by spirits (adds a multi-tiered, slightly detuned delay effect)

## Bonus: Bagpipe mode

Open two Sweet Tooths in two different tabs. Leave the first one playing the lowest possible pitch and then play a melody on the second one in either `MUS` or `THRM` mode.
